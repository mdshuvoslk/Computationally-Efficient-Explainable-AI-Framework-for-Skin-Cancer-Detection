- Recall: 96.1%
- F1 Score: 95.4%

## Checkpoint Information
- Model: EfficientNetB7
- Checkpoint Save Path: /model_checkpoints/efficientnetb7_best_weights.h5
- Training Steps: 5000
- Validation Steps: 1000
- Learning Rate: 0.0001

## Overfitting Analysis
- Training Loss: 0.05
- Validation Loss: 0.12
- Observations: The model shows signs of overfitting after 3000 training steps as validation loss increases while training loss decreases. Use of regularization techniques and early stopping is advised.
